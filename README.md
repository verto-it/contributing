## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

If you encounter any bugs while using our software, feel free to report them! To ensure we can address the issue efficiently, please provide as much detail as possible:

1. **Search for existing issues:** Before creating a new issue, check if the bug has already been reported.
2. **Create a new issue:** If no existing issue covers your bug, open a new one. Include the following information:
   - A clear title.
   - Steps to reproduce the issue.
   - The expected outcome.
   - The actual outcome (including error messages or screenshots if possible).
   - Any relevant information about your environment (e.g., operating system, version of the software, etc.).

### Suggesting Enhancements

We welcome ideas for improving our projects! If you have a suggestion:

1. **Check for existing feature requests:** See if the feature you want has already been suggested. If it has, feel free to add any additional details or thoughts.
2. **Create a new issue:** If it's a new idea, create an issue describing the enhancement. Be as detailed as possible, including why the feature is needed and potential use cases.

### Contributing Code

We are happy to accept pull requests! To get started:

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub.
2. **Create a new branch** based on the task you're working on:
   - For bug fixes, use `fix/issue-number`.
   - For new features, use `feature/short-description`.
3. **Make your changes** in the new branch.
4. **Test your changes** thoroughly.
5. **Commit your changes** with a clear and concise commit message.
6. **Push your branch** to your forked repository.
7. **Open a pull request** against the `main` branch of the original repository.

Your pull request will be reviewed by one of our maintainers. Please be patient, as we strive to ensure code quality before merging changes.

### Improving Documentation

Good documentation is just as important as good code! If you notice any areas of our documentation that need improvement, we encourage you to contribute:

1. **Find the documentation file** you'd like to improve.
2. **Make your edits** and ensure they are clear and concise.
3. **Follow the same process as contributing code** (fork, branch, pull request).
